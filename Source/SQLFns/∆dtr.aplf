 trim←{rmv}∆dtr data;⎕IO;⎕ML
⍝∇ <D>eletes all <TR>ailing spaces
⍝∇ (or zeros/prototypes/∆dtr-prototypes) from the rows of any array.
⍝∇ A left argument may be specified with a vector of item values
⍝∇ to be removed instead of spaces/zeros/[∆dtr-]prototypes.
⍝ A "∆dtr-prototype", defined as the ∆dtr of the prototype,
⍝ is additionally removed when the data is nested.
⍝ For convenience, if both the left and right arguments are given as
⍝ simple (unnested) values, and their datatypes (character or numeric)
⍝ are different, then the right argument will be returned unchanged
⍝ (not even ravelled, as can otherwise be common for this function).
⍝ For instance, this allows the removal of spaces from each item
⍝ of a nested array without ravelling any numeric scalars that may
⍝ also be found in that array.
