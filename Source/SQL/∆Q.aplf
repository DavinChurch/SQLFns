 q←{m}∆Q x
⍝∇ Enclose string(s) in quotes (doubling internal quotes as needed)
⍝ Optional left argument specifies quote type ("'", '"', or ''≡none) to use.
⍝ Left argument may be two symbols for begin/end (e.g. "[]" or "()").
⍝ If left argument does not contain either standard quote type, then imbedded
⍝ copies of those characters are not doubled (assuming that they're just
⍝ wrapper chars and not true quotes).
